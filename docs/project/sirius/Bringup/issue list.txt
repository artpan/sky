Sirius project issue list:
2018-03-01
1. H2H async logic has bug case:
	-- SINGLE(W)+INCR4(R)	, lost data
	-- INCR(W), lost data
	-- M7 request single Read/Write for Device space, if combine the 0/4 address write in 64bit, will generate INCR(W), lost data
	
2. GPIO block can be reduced area. Every one GPIO block can support 32x A/B/C/D group. now instance 5x GPIO(32) = 160. Future can only instance 2. one is 32x4+32 = 160.
3. QSPI flash need support below features
	-- 256Byte page program , to fix program speed issue 
	-- SPI NAND CMD list, 	to fix support SPI NAND access 
	-- opt, need support DMA mode, add DMA master to read/write flash to DDR.
	
4. ROM code need update
	-- support more eMMC/SPI flash type by OTP bit information
	-- add system self-check program.

5. Audio PLL support HW mode.

6. HDMI RX EDID support HW access mode, I2C interface to Register file 256Byte space.
